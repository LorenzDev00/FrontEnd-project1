## My process

1 - Setting the general HTML layout 
2 - Building the layout styling using Scss 
3 - Adding modules for specific parts of the project 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first challenge.
I've learnt that is better to start doing something rather then doing nothing.
Yes... that's mainstream but is true. 

### Continued development

#Future ideas üìù
- Revise Scss rules to reduce the aoumnt of .scss files and make them more dinamic
- Make the layout using Grid instead 

#Still need patience on these üòë
- Media queries 
- css units 
- Responsive Design 

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Had a look here to review how to code some of the styling and responsive details.
